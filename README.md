# Cryptographic Algorithms Simulation

An application that simulates the operation of simple cryptographic algorithms: Rail fence, Myszkowski, and Playfair.

## Registration

When you register, the application creates a certificate for you.

## Login

You need to use the certificate, username, and password when you try to login.

## Algorithm Selection

After successful login, you can choose one of three simple cryptographic algorithms.

## Encryption Process

When you choose an algorithm, you have to input the key and plaintext that you want to protect.

## History and Security

All your actions are saved in a history file, which is only visible from the application. It is protected with AES and the user's private key. If someone tries to change it, the authorized user will be notified.
