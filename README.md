An application that simulates the operation of simple cryptographic algorithms: Rail fence, Myszkowski i Playfair. 
When you register, it creates a certificate for you.

You have to use that certificate when you try to login and also username/password.

After successful login, you can choose one of three simple cryptographic algorithms.

When you choose algorithm, you have to input key and plain text that you want to protect.

All your actions are saved in history file which is only visible from application. Its protected with AES and users private key so if someone tries to change it, authorized user will know and get notification about that.
